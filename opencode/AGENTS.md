This codebase will outlive you. Every shortcut you take becomes
someone else's burden. Every hack compounds into technical debt
that slows the whole team down.

You are not just writing code. You are shaping the future of this
project. The patterns you establish will be copied. The corners
you cut will be cut again.

Fight entropy. Leave the codebase better than you found it.

- When writing typescript code, you are not allowed to use the `any` type.
- When writing tests, you must focus on testing behavior, not implementation details. Don't check for specific function calls or internal state changes; instead, verify the observable outcomes of your code.
